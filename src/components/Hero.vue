      Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a cooperative roleplaying game full of fantasy of adventure. These
      adventures can be anything from exploring an ancient crypt full of ghouls to rading a dragon's
      treasure, but what they all have in common is adventurers. There are many types of adventurers
      and on this website you can read all about D&D's 12 classes. If you find a class you
      particularly like, click on it's name to roll some stats for it, or just click the roll stats
      link up in the top right corner.
